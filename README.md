## github branch: nano-9::::github SHA: 3396391da6e872cba897f038a9f4fbbc556f7751


This project consists of two main components: an **iOS application** developed in SwiftUI for later model iPhones and an **Arduino ESP32-based sprinkler system**. 

The iOS app monitors and controls a sprinkler system by sending HTTP commands to an Arduino Nano ESP32 in the sprinkler controller which controls a relay that can power a water pump for sprinkling.

## Overview

This sprinkler control system enables you to manage and automate watering schedules for your lawn. The system consists of an iOS app that acts as the user interface and sends control commands to an Arduino Nano ESP32 via HTTP. The Arduino manages the hardware by controlling a relay that activates a water pump for sprinkling.

## System Components

### iOS Application

#### Features
- Monitor the status of the sprinkler system.
- Manually control the sprinklers (turn on/off).
- Set and modify watering schedules.
- Adjust the system IP address dynamically for communication.

#### Requirements
- iOS 15.0 or later.
- Developed in SwiftUI.
- Network access to communicate with the Arduino device.

#### Installation
1. Go to your git directory
    ```zsh
    cd ~/git
    ```
2. Clone the repository:
   ```zsh
   git clone git@github.com:SeaGuy/raindance.git
   ```
2. Open the project (~/Project/git/raindance/src/raindance) in Xcode.
3. Build and run the application on your iOS device.

### Sprinkler Controller Firmware

#### Features
- Receives and processes HTTP commands from the iOS app.
- Controls a relay to activate or deactivate the water pump.
- Manages schedules and timing of watering.
- Monitors and sends back system status updates to the app.

#### Requirements
- Arduino Nano ESP32 microprocessor
- Arduino IDE 

#### Firmware Installation
1. Clone the entire repository from github if needed.

   ```zsh
   git clone git@github.com:SeaGuy/raindance.git
   ```
2. Use the Arduino IDE *Library Manager* to install the necessary libraries 
- <TimeLib.h>, Time by Michale Margolis
- <TimeAlarms.h>, TimeAlarms by Michale Margolis
- `WiFiNINA`
- <ArduinoHttpClient.h>, ArduinoHttpClient by Arduino
- <Arduino_JSON.h>, Arduino_JSON by Arduino
- <NTPClient.h>, NTPClient by Fabrice Weinberg
3. Upload the sketch to the Arduino Nano ESP32 via the Arduino IDE.

#### Hardware Setup
- **Arduino Nano ESP32**: The core microcontroller for the project.
- **Relay Module**: Controls the water pump.
  
![This is a alt text.](/images/relay-1.jpg)

- **Water Pump**: Performs the actual sprinkling.
- **Power Supply**: Provides power to the relay and pump.
- **Wiring**: Connect the relay to the appropriate GPIO pins on the Arduino Nano ESP32. The relay should control the power to the water pump.

The pins of the Arduino are inserted into headers which are soldered to a quarter-size Perma-Proto breadboard PCB, so that the Arduino can be removed and reinserted without soldering.

The active Arduino pins are:
- Vin (voltage in):  uses an internal voltage regulator which converts any voltage between 5-12vdc into the system voltage of 3.3vdc. The 5vdc power  supplied by the switching power supply will be wired here.
- GND (ground):  will be wired to the GND bus bar
- D7 (digital output 7):  controlled by firmware to enable or disable the relay

## HTTP Commands

### Command List
The iOS app sends HTTP POST commands to control the Arduino Nano ESP32. The following commands are supported:

- **Turn Sprinkler ON:**
  - `POST /sprinkler/on`
  - Activates the relay to start the water pump.
  
- **Turn Sprinkler OFF:**
  - `POST /sprinkler/off`
  - Deactivates the relay to stop the water pump.
  
- **Set Schedule:**
  - `POST /schedule`
  - Sets or updates a watering schedule.

- **Get Status:**
  - `GET /status`
  - Returns the current system status, including whether the sprinkler is on or off.

### Example Requests

#### Turn Sprinkler ON
\``bash
POST /sprinkler/on
Host: 192.168.1.100
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "command": "ON"
}
\``

#### Turn Sprinkler OFF
\``bash
POST /sprinkler/off
Host: 192.168.1.100
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "command": "OFF"
}
\``

#### Set Schedule
\``bash
POST /schedule
Host: 192.168.1.100
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "startTime": "06:00",
  "duration": 15
}
\``

## Usage
1. Ensure the Arduino Nano ESP32 is connected to the same network as the iOS app.
2. Use the iOS app to control the sprinkler system:
   - Tap the **Sprinkler ON** button to activate the water pump.
   - Tap the **Sprinkler OFF** button to deactivate the water pump.
   - Set a schedule by specifying the start time and duration.
3. The app will communicate with the Arduino to send commands and display the status of the sprinkler system.

## Issues
1. [1/17/2025] Seeing this during board initialization:  "PrintSprinklerSchedule()->scheduleName: <kï¿½?>::zones: <255>::durationMinutes: <255>::numberOfTimeSchedules: <255>
PrintSprinkSerial port connected"
2. [1/18/2025] send current schedule to iPhone.  Is there room for two clocks or times?
3. [1/19/2025] if schedule is not valid at powerup, a default shedule is used.  But then a schedule cannot be added from the app:  "Limit Reached" popup.
